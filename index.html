				This is my personal home/placeholder-ish site. Here you can mostly just find links to other projects
				I've worked on in my spare time, and current things I'm experimenting with.
			</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/just6979/www.justinwhite.net">It's just HTML and CSS</a>.
				If something looks broken, assume I'm testing changes and will be pushing fixes through version control soon.

			<h3>Resume</h3>

				<a href="/resume/">My resume</a> is available as a modern, responsive HTML document.
				Based on a template from

			<p>
				A small web app I made to check nearby
				tides. I used to frequent a beach that allowed dogs year-round, but it was very very small at high tide,
				and I wanted a way to quickly see the current tide as a glance. It currently uses the NOAA Tides & Currents
				APIs for data, and I've been porting it to various frameworks and hosting services as a learning experience.

				These are some ideas I've head floating around in my head, some for years, some newish, all I would like
				to get going someday, in no particular order.
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>RC racing game</dt>
				<dd>I always likes the physics of racing miniature vehicles through full sized environments. Re-Volt,
					released for PC and PS[2?], is a great example. Would be cool to model a range of real-world RC
					vehicles, to see if that old Tyco electric buggy you got when you were a kid could keep up with a
					modern four-wheel-drive, gas-powered truggy, and to see how that old car would perform with a couple
					well-chosen upgrades.
				</dd>
				<dt>Mine-based flight/fight game</dt>
				<dd>Much like Descent. I loved Descent 1 & 2, and Descent 3 was a great game, but not quite the same as
					the first two. I'd like to recreate the feeling of first games, perhaps with some huge rooms, and
					maybe a tiny bit of outside flight, but only as, say, a shortcut or alternative route around
					something, not having outdoors be a big part. If the player does end up outside, I want to really
					show the scale of the mine being inside something the size of an asteroid, ie: see the curve of the
					outside shell. I would also like to experiment with organic looking, possibly procedurally
					generated, level design.
				</dd>
				<dt>Deep Wiki Engine</dt>
				<dd>Basically, a web site management engine where everything, and I mean everything, from individual
					page content to templates to stylesheets and maybe even scripts, is editable through the browser
					interface. Revision control will have to be an integral part, along with a few pieces (fall-back
					editor, for example) that cannot be edited through the browser. Kind-of started this idea on App
					Engine.

				I dig distributed version control.
				I started with Subversion (which is not distributed),
				but quickly switched to Mercurial,
				and I've now moved to Git like almost everyone else.
