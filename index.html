<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This is my personal home/placeholder-ish site. Here you can mostly just find links to other projects I've worked on in my spare time, and current things I'm experimenting with.
</p>
<p>
This shouldn't break very often, since it's just static files, but I may add a tiny bit of programming to maintain a consistent look (header, footer, base styles) through all the local experiments; so if something looks broken, assume I'm testing changes and will be pushing fixes through version control soon.
</p>
<p>
I also maintain a <a href="http://blog.justinwhite.net/">blog</a> at Blogger, but it is infrequently updated. This may change with the faster Blogger dashboard, new Android app, and Google+ integration.

<h2>Potential Projects</h2>
<p>
These are some ideas I've head floating around in my head, some for years, some newish, all I would like to get going someday, in no particular order.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Interval training Android app</dt>
        <dd>Simply set warm-up and cool-down times, work and rest times, interval count, hit go, turn on your motivational music, go get fit. There are a bunch like this on the Android Market, but most either look terrible or have tons of extra crap. The only other thing I'd add is profiles for different workouts.</dd>
    <dt>RC racing game</dt>
        <dd>I always likes the physics of racing miniature vehicles through full sized environments. Re-Volt, released for PC and PS[2?], is a great example.</dd>
    <dt>Mine-based flight/fight game</dt>
        <dd>Much like Descent. I loved Descent 1 & 2, and Descent 3 was a great game, but not quite the same as the first two. I'd like to recreate the feeling of first games, perhaps with some huge rooms, and maybe a tiny bit of outside flight, but only as, say, a shortcut or alternative route around something, not having outdoors be a big part. If the player does end up outside, I want to really show the scale of the mine being inside something the size of an asteroid, ie: see the curve of the outside shell. I would also like to experiment with organic looking, possibly procedurally generated, level design.</dd>
    <dt>Deep Wiki Engine</dt>
        <dd>Basically, a web site management engine where everything, and I mean everything, from individual page content to templates to stylesheets and maybe even scripts, is editable through the browser interface. Revision control will have to be an integral part, along with a few pieces (fall-back editor, for example) that cannot be edited through the browser. Kind-of started this idea on App Engine.</dd>
    <dt>Others</dt>
        <dd>Coming when I think of them.</dd>

<h2>Source Repositories</h2>
<p>
I love [distributed] version control. I started with Subversion, which is not distributed, but quickly switched to Mercurial for my own projects, and I've now also used Git for various contributions. Depending on the project, I use various hosting services:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="http://bitbucket.org/just6979">Bitbucket</a></dt>
        <dd>Personal repositories, because Mercurial runs everywhere!</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://github.com/just6979">GitHub</a></dt>
        <dd>Contributions to CyanogenMod or anything else already on GitHub</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://code.google.com/u/109007983296189609553/">Google Code</a></dt>
        <dd>App Engine projects, for Google Account usage.</dd>
